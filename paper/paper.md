# Introduction

As part of the BioHackathon Europe 2023, we here report...




### Author identifiers

Ideally, authors provide their [ORCID](https://orcid.org/) identifier. For affiliations, It is added with the `orcid:` field.
So, and author record would look like this:

```yaml
authors:
  - name: First Author
    affiliation: 1
    orcid: 0000-0000-0000-0000
```

### Research Organization Registry identifiers

Matching the author identifier, the affiliations can be further specified with the
[Research Organization Registry](https://ror.org/) (ROR) identifier.
For example, this is the affiliation identifier can be added with the `ror:` field:

```yaml
affiliations:
  - name: ELIXIR Europe
    ror: 044rwnt51
    index: 2
```

### Contributor Role Taxonomy

A last feature since is minimal support for the Contributor Role Taxonomy (CRediT). You
can specify the role of authors in writing the report with the `role:` field. However,
the authors are responsible for selection the right terms from [CRediT](https://credit.niso.org/).
An example looks like this:

```yaml
authors:
  - name: First Author
    affiliation: 1
    orcid: 0000-0000-0000-0000
    role: Conceptualization, Writing – review & editing
```

### A full examples

A full example then has this structure:

```yaml
authors:
  - name: First Author
    affiliation: 1
    role: Writing – original draft
  - name: Last Author
    orcid: 0000-0000-0000-0000
    affiliation: 2
    role: Conceptualization, Writing – review & editing
affiliations:
  - name: First Affiliation
    index: 1
  - name: ELIXIR Europe
    ror: 044rwnt51
    index: 2
```

# Formatting

This document use Markdown and you can look at [this tutorial](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).

## Subsection level 2

Please keep sections to a maximum of only two levels.

## Tables

Tables can be added in the following way, though alternatives are possible:

```markdown
Table: Note that table caption is automatically numbered and should be
given before the table itself.

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| item 1 | item 2 |
| item 3 | item 4 |
```

This gives:

Table: Note that table caption is automatically numbered and should be
given before the table itself.

| Header 1 | Header 2 |
| -------- | -------- |
| item 1 | item 2 |
| item 3 | item 4 |

## Figures

A figure is added with:

```markdown
![Caption for BioHackrXiv logo figure](./biohackrxiv.png)
```

This gives:

![Caption for BioHackrXiv logo figure](./biohackrxiv.png)

Figures can be scaled by adding the width or height to the Markdown like this:

```markdown
![Caption for BioHackrXiv logo figure](./biohackrxiv.png){ width=50px }
```

# Other main section on your manuscript level 1

Lists can be added with:

1. Item 1
2. Item 2

# Citation Typing Ontology annotation

You can use [CiTO](http://purl.org/spar/cito/2018-02-12) annotations, as explained in [this BioHackathon Europe 2021 write up](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/biohackrxiv/bhxiv-metadata/main/doc/elixir_biohackathon2021/paper.md) and [this CiTO Pilot](https://www.biomedcentral.com/collections/cito).
Using this template, you can cite an article and indicate _why_ you cite that article, for instance DisGeNET-RDF [@citesAsAuthority:Queralt2016].

The syntax in Markdown is as follows: a single intention annotation looks like
`[@usesMethodIn:Krewinkel2017]`; two or more intentions are separated
with colons, like `[@extends:discusses:Nielsen2017Scholia]`. When you cite two
different articles, you use this syntax: `[@citesAsDataSource:Ammar2022ETL; @citesAsDataSource:Arend2022BioHackEU22]`.

Possible CiTO typing annotation include:

* citesAsDataSource: when you point the reader to a source of data which may explain a claim
* usesDataFrom: when you reuse somehow (and elaborate on) the data in the cited entity
* usesMethodIn
* citesAsAuthority
* citesAsEvidence
* citesAsPotentialSolution
* citesAsRecommendedReading
* citesAsRelated
* citesAsSourceDocument
* citesForInformation
* confirms
* documents
* providesDataFor
* obtainsSupportFrom
* discusses
* extends
* agreesWith
* disagreesWith
* updates
* citation: generic citation
